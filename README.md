Currently testing how well keeping notes in Markdown through git works.
This is public because someone in my class might find any of these notes useful.
But mainly because I want to be able to access this without needing to authenticate.

Though I'm mainly a codeberg user, I don't really like the idea of swamping their
servers with two-billion images. GitHub? Now that's another thing.
Suck my 2TB worth of images Copilot.
